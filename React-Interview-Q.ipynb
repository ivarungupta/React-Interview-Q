    "Here's a detailed guide with examples for all 62 questions to help you prepare for your tech interviews:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **What is React?**\n",
    "React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications (SPAs). It allows developers to create reusable UI components.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   import React from 'react';\n",
    "   const HelloWorld = () => <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;\n",
    "   export default HelloWorld;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM**\n",
    "- **Real DOM** updates the entire tree structure whenever changes are made.\n",
    "- **Virtual DOM** is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. React updates only the parts of the DOM that need changes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>; // Virtual DOM\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Key Features of React**\n",
    "- Declarative UI\n",
    "- Component-Based\n",
    "- Virtual DOM\n",
    "- Unidirectional data flow\n",
    "- JSX Syntax\n",
    "  \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const App = () => <div>Hello, React!</div>;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **What is JSX?**\n",
    "JSX is a syntax extension that looks similar to HTML but is used in React to describe UI components.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const element = <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Why can't browsers read JSX?**\n",
    "Browsers can only understand plain JavaScript, and JSX is not valid JavaScript. JSX needs to be transpiled into regular JavaScript using Babel or another compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **What are React Components?**\n",
    "Components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be class-based or function-based.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const HelloWorld = () => <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Class vs. Functional Components**\n",
    "- **Class Components**: Can hold state and lifecycle methods.\n",
    "- **Functional Components**: Use hooks to manage state and lifecycle methods.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Class Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   class Welcome extends React.Component {\n",
    "     render() {\n",
    "       return <h1>Hello, Class Component!</h1>;\n",
    "     }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Functional Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const Welcome = () => <h1>Hello, Functional Component!</h1>;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **State vs. Props in React**\n",
    "- **State**: Internal data of a component.\n",
    "- **Props**: External data passed to a component.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const Welcome = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **What are React Hooks?**\n",
    "Hooks let you use state and other React features in functional components.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Common Hooks**:\n",
    "   - `useState`\n",
    "   - `useEffect`\n",
    "   - `useContext`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **How do useState and useEffect work?**\n",
    "- **useState**: Manages component state.\n",
    "- **useEffect**: Handles side effects such as data fetching or manual DOM updates.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n",
    "   useEffect(() => {\n",
    "     document.title = `Count is ${count}`;\n",
    "   }, [count]);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. **Importance of Key in React**\n",
    "Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. It improves list rendering performance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const list = items.map((item) => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. **Lifting State Up**\n",
    "State is \"lifted\" to the nearest common ancestor so that multiple child components can share the state.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const Parent = () => {\n",
    "     const [data, setData] = useState('');\n",
    "     return <Child data={data} />;\n",
    "   };\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. **Passing Data Between Components**\n",
    "Data is passed from parent to child using props.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const Parent = () => <Child message=\"Hello\" />;\n",
    "   const Child = (props) => <h1>{props.message}</h1>;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. **New Features in React 18**\n",
    "- Automatic Batching\n",
    "- Concurrent Rendering\n",
    "- `useTransition` hook\n",
    "- `useDeferredValue` hook\n",
    "- Improved Suspense\n",
    "  \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15. **Concurrent Rendering in React 18**\n",
    "Concurrent rendering allows React to interrupt and prioritize rendering tasks without blocking the UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16. **Automatic Batching in React 18**\n",
    "React 18 batches multiple state updates automatically to reduce the number of renders.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   setCount((prev) => prev + 1);\n",
    "   setFlag(true); // Batches these updates\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17. **useTransition Hook**\n",
    "It allows you to mark updates as non-urgent, improving UI responsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n",
    "   startTransition(() => {\n",
    "     setData(newData);\n",
    "   });\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18. **useDeferredValue Hook**\n",
    "It defers a value until the render is less urgent, allowing for smoother rendering of lower-priority content.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(value);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19. **What is Suspense in React?**\n",
    "Suspense lets components \"wait\" for some code to load, such as when performing lazy loading.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20. **How Has React 18 Improved Suspense?**\n",
    "React 18 enhances Suspense for concurrent rendering, which allows it to pause renders and continue without blocking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 21. **startTransition Function in React 18**\n",
    "It is used to mark updates as non-urgent.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   startTransition(() => {\n",
    "     setCount(count + 1);\n",
    "   });\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 22. **useTransition vs. startTransition**\n",
    "- `useTransition`: For concurrent updates within functional components.\n",
    "- `startTransition`: For concurrent updates outside functional components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 23. **Using Concurrent Features in React 18**\n",
    "You can use hooks like `useTransition`, `useDeferredValue`, and Suspense to implement concurrent rendering.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   startTransition(() => setData(newData));\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 24. **React 18's Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Enhancements**\n",
    "React 18 introduces concurrent features in SSR, such as streaming responses and faster page load times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 25. **What are React Server Components?**\n",
    "React Server Components allow components to be rendered on the server, which optimizes the performance of complex applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 26. **Role of ConcurrentMode in React 18**\n",
    "`ConcurrentMode` allows React to perform multiple state updates in a single pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 27. **React Lifecycle Methods**\n",
    "- **Mounting**: `constructor()`, `componentDidMount()`\n",
    "- **Updating**: `componentDidUpdate()`\n",
    "- **Unmounting**: `componentWillUnmount()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 28. **React Context API**\n",
    "It allows passing data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const MyContext = React.createContext();\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 29. **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)**\n",
    "HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with enhanced behavior.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const EnhancedComponent = withFeature(OriginalComponent);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 30. **React Forms and Controlled Components**\n",
    "Controlled components have their state controlled by React, usually via `useState`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const [value, setValue] = useState('');\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 31. **Uncontrolled Components in React**\n",
    "Uncontrolled components allow the DOM to control the form data rather than React managing the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const Input = () => (\n",
    "     <input type=\"text\" defaultValue=\"Default Value\" />\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 32. **What is Prop Drilling, and How Can It Be Avoided?**\n",
    "Prop drilling occurs when you pass data through multiple layers of components, even when some components do not need the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Avoid Prop Drilling** with the **Context API**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const DataContext = React.createContext();\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 33. **React Portals**\n",
    "Portals provide a way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the main DOM hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   ReactDOM.createPortal(<Child />, document.getElementById('portal-root'));\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 34. **Significance of shouldComponentUpdate Method**\n",
    "This lifecycle method is used to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary renders.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {\n",
    "     return nextProps.value !== this.props.value;\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 35. **React Fragments**\n",
    "Fragments let you group multiple children elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const FragmentExample = () => (\n",
    "     <React.Fragment>\n",
    "       <h1>Title</h1>\n",
    "       <p>Description</p>\n",
    "     </React.Fragment>\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 36. **Memoization in React using React.memo and useMemo**\n",
    "- **React.memo**: Memoizes the result of a component render.\n",
    "- **useMemo**: Memoizes a value computed from dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(() => <ChildComponent />);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **useMemo Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const computedValue = useMemo(() => expensiveCalculation(), [dependencies]);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 37. **Optimizing Performance in React**\n",
    "- Memoization with `React.memo` and `useMemo`\n",
    "- Lazy Loading Components\n",
    "- Avoid unnecessary re-renders with `shouldComponentUpdate` or `React.PureComponent`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 38. **Rules for Using React Hooks**\n",
    "- Only call hooks at the top level of a component.\n",
    "- Only call hooks from React function components or custom hooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 39. **Handling Errors in React using Error Boundaries**\n",
    "Error boundaries catch JavaScript errors in their child component tree and display fallback UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {\n",
    "     componentDidCatch(error, info) {\n",
    "       console.log(error, info);\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     render() {\n",
    "       return this.props.children;\n",
    "     }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 40. **What is componentDidCatch() Method in React?**\n",
    "`componentDidCatch()` is a lifecycle method used by error boundaries to catch errors during rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 41. **Synthetic Events in React**\n",
    "Synthetic events are cross-browser wrappers around the native browser events, providing a consistent API across different browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const handleClick = (event) => console.log(event);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 42. **How Can You Test a React Component?**\n",
    "You can test a React component using testing libraries like **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 43. **Role of Jest in React Testing**\n",
    "Jest is a testing framework used to run tests and assertions in React applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 44. **Shallow Rendering vs. Full Rendering in Testing**\n",
    "- **Shallow Rendering**: Only renders the top-level component.\n",
    "- **Full Rendering**: Renders both the parent and child components.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   import { shallow } from 'enzyme';\n",
    "   shallow(<MyComponent />);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 45. **Implementing Lazy Loading in React**\n",
    "Lazy loading defers loading components until they are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 46. **Testing React Hooks**\n",
    "You can use libraries like `@testing-library/react-hooks` to test hooks directly.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   import { renderHook } from '@testing-library/react-hooks';\n",
    "   const { result } = renderHook(() => useCustomHook());\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 47. **Handling Forms and Validations in React**\n",
    "Forms are managed using controlled components and state.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   For validation, libraries like **Formik** or **Yup** can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 48. **What is Redux, and How Does It Relate to React?**\n",
    "Redux is a state management library often used with React to manage the application state in a predictable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const store = createStore(reducer);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49. **Key Principles of Redux**\n",
    "- Single source of truth (store)\n",
    "- State is read-only\n",
    "- Changes are made with pure functions (reducers)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 50. **Actions, Reducers, and Store in Redux**\n",
    "- **Actions**: Describe changes in the application.\n",
    "- **Reducers**: Pure functions that define how the state changes.\n",
    "- **Store**: Holds the application state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 51. **Difference Between useReducer and Redux**\n",
    "- `useReducer`: A hook that manages local state inside components.\n",
    "- **Redux**: Manages global state across the entire app.\n",

    "### 52. **Connecting Redux to React**\n",
    "`react-redux` library provides `Provider` to pass down the store and `connect()` or hooks like `useSelector()` and `useDispatch()` to access the store.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const dispatch = useDispatch();\n",
    "   const state = useSelector(state => state);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 53. **React Middlewares in Redux**\n",
    "Middlewares in Redux allow you to handle asynchronous actions or log actions. Examples include:\n",
    "- **Redux Thunk**\n",
    "- **Redux Saga**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 54. **What are Thunks in Redux?**\n",
    "Thunks are functions that return another function to handle asynchronous actions like fetching data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const fetchData = () => (dispatch) => {\n",
    "     fetch('/api/data')\n",
    "       .then(response => response.json())\n",
    "       .then(data => dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_SUCCESS', payload: data }));\n",
    "   };\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 55. **Handling Asynchronous Actions in Redux**\n",
    "This is typically done with middlewares like **Redux Thunk** or **Redux Saga**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 56. **Differences Between Redux, Context API, and MobX**\n",
    "- **Redux**: Centralized state management with a strict flow.\n",
    "- **Context API**: Simple state management for small to medium apps.\n",
    "- **MobX**: Reactive state management with observable values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 57. **What is React Router?**\n",
    "React Router is a library for handling routing in React applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   <BrowserRouter>\n",
    "     <Route path=\"/home\" component={Home} />\n",
    "   </BrowserRouter>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 58. **Implementing Dynamic Routing in React**\n",
    "Dynamic routing is done by passing parameters to routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   <Route path=\"/user/:id\" component={User} />\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 59. **Difference Between BrowserRouter and HashRouter**\n",
    "- **BrowserRouter**: Uses the HTML5 history API for cleaner URLs.\n",
    "- **HashRouter**: Uses the URL hash for navigation, which is useful for older browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 60. **Significance of Route and Switch in React Router**\n",
    "- **Route**: Defines a component to render when the URL matches.\n",
    "- **Switch**: Renders the first matching route.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   <Switch>\n",
    "     <Route exact path=\"/\" component={Home} />\n",
    "     <Route path=\"/about\" component={About} />\n",
    "   </Switch>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 61. **Passing Parameters in React Router**\n",
    "You can pass parameters via the URL and access them via `useParams()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const { id } = useParams();\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 62. **Nested Routes in React Router**\n",
    "Nested routes allow you to render routes inside other routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   <Route path=\"/dashboard\" component={Dashboard}>\n",
    "     <Route path=\"/dashboard/profile\" component={Profile} />\n",
    "   </Route>\n",
    "   ```\n",
